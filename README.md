# Deep-Learning-Projects
This repository contains three projects, each exploring different aspects of deep learning for real-world applications.

## Datasets Used
### 1. MNIST Dataset
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits, commonly used for training image processing systems. It consists of 70,000 labeled images of digits from 0 to 9, with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. This dataset is a popular benchmark in machine learning for classification tasks and is widely used to evaluate the performance of classification algorithms.

### 2. Delhi Weather Data 
This dataset contains weather data collected from the city of Delhi over a period of four years (from 2013 to 2017). It includes various parameters like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pressure, making it suitable for training machine learning models.
